* YALL a simple extensible lisp dialect

This program consists of two parts 1 the demo script which feeds some
example code into a non interactive YALL process.

The other part is an the yall executable it's self.

you can run it interactively with

```
yall -i
```

or

```
yall --interactive
```

If you want to pass it input from an existing file run

```
yall < file_to_run.scm
```

Since yall is heavily inspired by scheme it's recommended to set your
editor to its' scheme or at least lisp mode for better syntax
highlighting.
